## Overview of the Application
Whether you own a non-profit organization or work as a lawyer, there are many ways you can make a difference in our society. The problem with selecting from these options is that for an ordinary student, choosing from these options isn't as effective. This is due to the fact that a lack of guidance renders these careers unattractive. Most students choose to study engineering and medicine, not analyzing their talents or strengths.

Everyone in this world has unique talents that they can contribute to society in many different ways.

<blockquote>Finding Passion is the key to success.</blockquote>
<br>
According to book Ikigai, passion is something is we love and that we are good at.
<br>
We have built an android application that will help students to find thier passion which will in turn help many people to work for what they really like.

### Intelligence Identification
One of the main goal is to identify strengths of the students for this brainstormed together in order to come up with a valid logic for correct intelligence. We had researched through various books and youtube videos. In the process, we looked at Howard Gardner's Multiple Theory of Intelligence. 

### Counsellor
We have provided a counsellor side for asking all doubts and providing a clear path for the user.

### Ecosystem
We have streamlined the process from finding strengths and getting all the queries addressed on how to proceed on a specific path.


## Tech-Stack

For building this application we have used a variety of application :

- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- Firebase
- Git 
- Github
- MLKit

## Future Implementations

Due to time constraints we have built only a part of the applications, these are some of the things we have planned for the future :

- Enabling multilingual support for all the parts of application.
- Increasing the database to accomodate every type of career.
- Implementing generalized search throughout the application using elasticsearch.
